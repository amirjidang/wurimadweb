Her mother and father had two more daughters, Debra and Patti.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Tate won her first beauty pageant, Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas, at the age of 6 months. She continued to model and compete in pageants as a teen and, as a high school student, became homecoming queen.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">While her father was stationed in California, Sharon would hitchhike to Hollywood, where she started doing commercials. Eventually, she was offered a contract with Filmways, which put her through acting, singing and dancing lessons.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Bit parts followed, usually involving a black wig, in television shows like “Petticoat Junction” and “The Beverly Hillbillies.” She also had roles in “The Americanization of Emily” and “The Sandpiper,” as well as the Dean Martin film, “The Wrecking Crew.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">For that film, Bruce Lee choreographed a fight scene for Tate and fellow actress Nancy Kwan, seen below.</p><p></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Tate was in an abusive relationship with a French actor, who once put her in a hospital, before meeting celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring and beginning one of the most significant romantic relationships in her life. She was still involved with Sebring in 1966 when she met acclaimed filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was about a decade older than Tate.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When Polanski directed Tate in a horror movie spoof, “The Fearless Vampire Killers,” the pair began seeing one another and Tate broke off her relationship with Sebring.

When her parents divorced 17 years later, Krenwinkel stayed with her father in California while her mother moved to Alabama.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">After high school, however, she moved to Alabama, where she attended a Catholic university.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Krenwinkel, who had considered becoming a nun, dropped out of school and went back to California, where she met Manson, Brunner and Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme on the beach. After having sex with Manson, she left with him and the women for San Francisco. She left her car and final paycheck behind to follow Manson, CieloDrive.com says.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Krenwinkel, who was described as quiet but intense, helped care for the children of the women in the family. She is credited with introducing Dennis Wilson, who picked her up hitchhiking, to Manson and the rest of the family.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Krenwinkel was involved in both the Tate and LaBianca murders. According to her own statements, she chased Abigail Folger from the house and continued to stab her to death on the front lawn.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Like the others, she was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. She was imprisoned at the California Institute for Women, where she has a perfect prison record.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She has received a bachelor’s degree in human services and is active in drug and alcohol treatment support groups. Krenwinkel also teaches fellow inmates how to read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><strong>Leslie Van Houten, 19</strong></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Leslie Van Houten, the youngest of the kllers, was born in 1949 in Los Angeles. She grew up with an older brother and two younger siblings adopted from Korea.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When she was a teen, her parents divorced and the children remained with their mother.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">At Monrovia High School, Van Houten was twice elected homecoming queen. She also began experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">After high school, Van Houten studied to become a legal secretary. She also dabbled in spiritualism and planned to live in a yogic spiritual community.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">It was while visiting friends in San Francisco during the summer of 1968 that Van Houten met some of Manson’s followers, who took her to meet him at Spahn Ranch, where the family was staying. She went for a second visit to the ranch a few weeks later and stayed.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I was absolutely intrigued and mesmerized by Manson and I believed that he was someone very special and extraordinary,” Van Houten would later say, according to CieloDrive.com.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Van Houten, who was involved in the LaBianca slayings, went along that night to prove herself to Manson and Krenwinkel, whom she particularly looked up to.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She helped Watson and Krenwinkel kill Rosemary LaBianca. She also wiped down the home for fingerprints before hitchhiking back to Spahn Ranch with the others.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Van Houten was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Like the others, her death sentence was commuted in 1972.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Van Houten’s route through the justice system was different from her those of her fellow family members. Her initial conviction was overturned because, during the first trial, her defense attorney, Ronald Hughes, vanished.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Many authorities suspected the family was responsible for Hughes' disappearance, though nothing could ever be proven. <a href=#>According to Los Angeles magazine</a>, Hughes' body was later found in Los Padres National Forest.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A second trial ended in a mistrial, and she was convicted at her third trial in 1978, nearly a decade after the murders.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The magazine reported that she was sentenced to seven years to life in prison.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Like some of her co-defendants, Van Houten has earned a college degree while imprisoned and has been active with Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Like Krenwinkel, she also teaches fellow inmates to read.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Van Houten has been recommended for parole three times in recent years, <a href=#>Los Angeles magazine reported</a>. Each time, California's governor has refused.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"Van Houten has failed to adequately explain to the panel how a model teenager from a privileged southern California family, who had once been a homecoming princess, could have turned into a ruthless killer by age 19," former Gov. Jerry Brown said, <a href=#>according to the publication</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Gov. Gavin Newsom most recently denied her parole in June, noting that her productivity in prison did not outweigh “the negative factors of her involvement in the murders.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Kay agreed with the denials <a href=#>in his interview with KTLA</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"I admit that she's a model prisoner, and I commend her for that, and I think she should keep doing her good work in prison," <a href=#>Kay said</a>. "But you know, the victims in this case were dead and buried in 1969. They don't get any parole."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><strong>Linda Kasabian, 20</strong></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Linda Kasabian was born Linda Drouin in 1949 in Maine.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Kasabian, who dropped out of school at 16, had been married twice by the time she was out of her teens. She and her second husband, Robert Kasabian, traveled from one hippie commune to another and, in March 1968, she gave birth to a daughter, Tanya.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Trouble in the marriage caused Linda to take Tanya to New Hampshire, but her husband talked her into reconciling in California. She followed him to Topanga Canyon, where she met Manson family member Catherine Share, aka “Gypsy.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">When her marriage again failed, Kasabian followed Share to Spahn Ranch, where she and her daughter joined the family.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Manson chose Kasabian to drive Watson, Atkins and Krenwinkel to the Tate residence on Cielo Drive the night of the killings because she was the only one with a valid driver’s license.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She did not participate in the slayings but witnessed Watson’s fatal shooting of Steven Parent. She also saw Watson and Krenwinkel kill Abigail Folger and Wojciech Frykowski.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She also drove the next night to the LaBianca house but left with Manson and Atkins before the killings.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Kasabian, who fled the ranch in fear after the murders, later agreed to testify against the killers and received immunity from prosecution.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She has mostly stayed out of the public eye over the past 50 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><strong>Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, 20</strong></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Lynette Fromme, who was born in Santa Monica in 1948, was one of Manson’s earliest followers, but was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A devoted family member, she sat outside the courthouse every day during Manson’s trial and, following his conviction,&nbsp;frequently moved to be closer to whatever prison he was in.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Fromme’s claim to infamy came not from the Manson murders, but from her Sept. 5, 1975, attempt to assassinate President Gerald Ford in Sacramento’s Capitol Park.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">At the time, Fromme was dedicated to saving California’s redwood trees. Wrapped in a red robe and carrying a Colt semi-automatic pistol, she approached Ford and drew the weapon.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Secret Service agents immediately took her into custody.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She was convicted of the assassination attempt and sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Fromme never wavered from her loyalty to Manson, escaping from the Alderson Federal Corrections Institute in West Virginia in 1987 after hearing a rumor that Manson had cancer. She was recaptured two days later.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">She spent the remainder of her sentence in facilities in Kentucky, Florida and Texas. She was released on parole in August 2009 at the age of 60 and moved to New York state to live with her boyfriend.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Fromme <a href=#>told ABC News in April</a> that she was still in love with Manson.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">"I don't think you fall out of love," <a href=#>she told the network</a>.
