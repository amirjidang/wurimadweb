Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>Yeah, we know – “best shampoos in the world” is a big claim, but we’re sure we’ve found them. Every single product on this list combines excellent ingredients with scientific roots, amazing results, and luxurious hair care experiences. Without a doubt, they’ve earned the title!</p><h2><strong>What Is Shampoo For?</strong></h2><p>A lot of stuff builds up on your hair and scalp throughout the day, and none of it’s good. Think sebum, dandruff, pollutants, dirt, dust, product residue – the list goes on. Shampoo exists to wash this buildup away, imparting benefits like increased softness, shine, and manageability. No matter your hair type or issue, there’s a shampoo out there that can give you the hair of your dreams. Shampoo is for banishing bad hair days!</p><h2><strong>What Makes a Great Shampoo?</strong></h2><p>A great shampoo is all about making your hair look and feel its best. Here are the elements to look for in a shampoo:</p><ul><li>Natural Ingredients: To get the best results and encourage healthy hair, you’ll want to stick to products with natural ingredients. Some of the best to look for include essential oils, aloe vera, and coconut-derived surfactants. These will clean your hair and give it an enviable glow without causing any damage.</li><li aria-level=1>No Toxins: When checking out the ingredient lists, it’s important not only to know what is in your shampoo but also what isn’t<i>. </i>Toxins like sulfates, parabens, silicone, formaldehyde, phthalates, and artificial dyes and fragrances are some of the worst offenders. These may strip your hair of essential moisture and irritate your scalp. Some even have additional negative health effects, so it’s best to steer clear of them.</li><li aria-level=1>Suits Your Hair Type: There are four hair types – straight, wavy, curly, and coily. Your hair care needs will vary depending on what kind of hair you have, so when looking for the right product try to find one that suits your hair type. Some shampoos state directly on the bottle what hair type they’re designed for.</li><li aria-level=1>A Pleasant Smell: Since scent lingers in your hair throughout the day, you want to look for a shampoo with a pleasant smell you’ll be happy to have around. Just try to avoid products with artificial fragrances, as that can be irritating to your skin.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Incorporate Shampoo Into Your Routine</strong></h2><p>The key to incorporating a great shampoo into your routine? Not using it every day! Experts recommend washing hair every two to three days to ensure that your hair is properly moisturized and not stripped of its natural oils.</p><p>Follow shampoo with conditioner for the best results, and use a hair oil before washing or styling to ensure moisture and shine. When styling, stay away from high heat and harmful chemical treatments. Your hair will thank you!</p><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Shampoo</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image23-11.png alt="Blu Atlas Shampoo" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Best shampoo in the world is quite a title, and it’s one that Blu Atlas shampoo absolutely deserves. This shampoo has got you covered no matter your hair type or hair woe – dryness, oily scalp, hair loss, etc.. It uses 99% naturally-derived ingredients to nourish the scalp and hair, leaving you with a healthier mane than you’ve previously experienced.</p><p>Let’s dive into this shampoo’s awesome formula. It contains jojoba oil, a prized hair ingredient that contains essential nutrients, antioxidants, and fatty acids. Since the texture of jojoba oil is similar to the sebum your scalp naturally produces, it can regulate sebum production and cut down on that greasy look. Then aloe vera soothes the scalp and imparts moisture plus extra nutrients to help your hair shine.</p><p>Saw palmetto hits the hair with anti-inflammatory powers and helps stop hormone-related hair thinning. Vegan biotin is another important ingredient, strengthening, protecting, and hydrating to add extra volume and thickness. This shampoo has all the goods, sure to give you plenty of good hair days. It comes in two scents: Classic or Coconut Apricot so you can optimize your hair care experience.</p><h3><strong>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">R+Co Television Perfect Hair Shampoo</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image25-7.png alt="R+Co Television Perfect Hair Shampoo" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The idea behind this formula from R+Co is to give you broadcast-worthy hair, and it definitely follows through. Using juniper berry extract to balance your scalp’s oil production, glycerin to fill the hair with much-needed moisture, and babassu seed oil to deeply condition, this shampoo ensures plenty of hydration and a glorious shine.</p><p>Panthenol is also included here, reinforcing hair and keeping it from splitting or fraying. This shampoo also smells great thanks to a scent called Dark Waves, a combination of cardamom, pineapple, tangerine, lavender, blond woods, and bamboo that will be hard to forget.</p><h3><strong>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Malin + Goetz Moisturizing Shampoo</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image16-26.png alt="Malin + Goetz Moisturizing Shampoo" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Malin and Goetz is known for straightforward, clean products – like this moisturizing shampoo. Dry hair is a common issue because it has so many triggers: the climate, the products you use, heat styling, blow drying, age, health problems, and more. That’s why this product contains plenty of hydrating ingredients to get rid of dryness and frizz and restore healthy, soft hair.</p><p>Amino acids contribute to this effect, cleansing without stripping hair of its natural moisture. Panthenol reinforces hair and moisturizes, plus there are plenty of other hydrating ingredients like glycol stearate and sodium PCA. These ingredients blend to make a formula especially suited for those with chemically processed hair.</p><h3><strong>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jupiter Balancing Shampoo</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image4-27.png alt="Jupiter Balancing Shampoo" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>When your hair and scalp get out of balance, that’s when annoying hair issues pop up. The point behind this product from Jupiter is to get everything back under control – leading to healthier, happier hair. Those with dandruff will find this product particularly helpful, as it contains pyrithione zinc to get rid of flakes.</p><p>Coconut oil, squalane, and sea kelp are the big moisturizers in this formula, providing plenty of micronutrients to encourage healthy hair, too. Lavender calms the scalp, apple fruit nourishes your hair follicles, and rosemary leaf oil busts inflammation and jumpstarts circulation in the scalp.
