One of those things is that the world is constantly going to be up in your business. It is just part of the job and the reality is that some people love the limelight more than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood is filled with all different kinds of celebrities. What we tend to forget is that celebrities are pretty much regular people who have more money and&nbsp;who are more popular than the public.</p><p>Like all humans, everyone is different. Some celebrities love the attention that comes with fame; they love the paparazzi, having their photos in the tabloids and the internet flooding with stories about them. On the other hand, there are some celebrities who love being under the radar; that you only hear about when they are promoting a new movie and whom you rarely see making the cover of tabloids.</p><p>We thought it would be fun to compare celebrities that love the limelight versus those celebrities that try their hardest to fly under the radar. From A-list movie stars to C-list reality stars, this list has all kinds of celebrities, proving that some people are simply cooler than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-kunis-low-key><strong>Mila Kunis: Low-Key</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a> has been in the world of show business for most of her life. The actress who got her big break on the show That '70s Show has had quite an impressive career. From appearing in films like Bad Moms, Black Swan, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Friends with Benefits it is cool that with all her fame, she still tries to fly under the radar.</p><p>Kunis is not one of those celebrities that craves paparazzi. She tries to keep her life as private as possible and even though she is married to another A-list celebrity, they have managed to keep their lives as private as they can.</p><p>Kunis has gone on record stating “That is the biggest form of bullying ever, the paparazzi. Printing lies, making accusations, it's just bullying,” which can explain why she avoids them at all costs.</p><h2 id=amber-rose-loves-attention><strong>Amber Rose: Loves Attention</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Rose</a> is one of those people with no business being famous. The “actress” is one of the people on the planet who craves the most attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose is known for dating as many rappers as she can and she prides herself on the fact that she does so. The fact that she dates these rappers is the only link to fame that she has and Rose is not going to let go of that fame easily.</p><p>Amber Rose once stated “Like every poor person, I used to dream about winning the lottery. I didn't just get money, though. I got fame. And I got fame before I got money, and it was scary” which is one of the most honest things she has ever said.</p><p>We do not hate Amber Rose, we just do not know how someone can need so much attention from the masses.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-low-key><strong>Jennifer Garner: Low-Key</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Garner</a> is one of the most adorable and underrated celebrities out there. The mother of three who was once married to superstar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a> tries to keep their lives and their children live as normal as possible.</p><p>Although Jennifer Garner is a huge superstar, her main job and priority are being a mother, and her actions show exactly that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We live in a celebrity-obsessed culture and Garner agrees with us “Why does everyone think they need to be a star? It's ridiculous. The celebrity culture is so silly, and the fact that people grow up thinking that it's something to aspire to just seems wrong. I don't mean to bash my life.
