For these celebrities, having their personal pictures leaked in such a manner must have been devastating. They must have had many a sleepless night, tossing and turning, worrying if their fans, friends, and family would stay by their side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are some celebrities, however, for whom appearing online in naked or nearly naked pictures is just a part of everyday life. You know the kind of celebrities I’m talking about. Not only are they perfectly fine with nude stills and videos of them being available on the internet, but they actively encourage it, sharing many of them on their personal Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. Some even pose for nude photo shoots to be featured in magazines and in the tabloids.</p><p>While it’s easy to brush these willing celebrities off as nothing more than fame hungry socialites whose ambitions far outweigh their talent, there are actually a number of reasons they choose to show their bodies so often. Some do it, admittedly, to raise their profile. That being said, there are some who do so for more noble reasons, such as to remove the stigma from the human body and to encourage other women to be comfortable in their own skin. Then there are those who just really, really like being naked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’re going to cover celebs from all of those categories and more in this article.</p><p>Here are 15 celebrities who just can’t keep their clothes on.</p><h2 id=salma-hayek><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></h2><p>Making it as a woman in Hollywood has never been easy, but it is a great deal easier now than it was in the past. As recently as 1995, actresses had little choice but to get naked on screen if they wanted audiences to remember them. It just so happens that 1995 was the year <a href=#>Salma Hayek</a> scored her first big acting gig, playing the role of Carolina in Desperado.</p><p>As was the custom at the time, audiences were treated to a moan-inducing scene between the leading man and woman. Hayek stripped down for a red hot sex scene with <a href=#>Antonio Banderas</a> and saw herself rise to the status of Latin sex symbol overnight. Hayek would show skin again and again and again after this film, appearing naked or partially naked in How To Make Love Like An Englishman and Ask The Dust, among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, Salma Hayek doesn’t show quite as much skin as she used to, choosing instead to cover her body with an array of leather outfits, which she claims her husband, François-Henri Pinault, finds irresistible. Of course, Hayek looks incredible regardless of what she wears or doesn’t wear.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p>As a teenager, <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> did not have the greatest body in the world. Or even in her class. Flat-chested and seriously underweight, she was often insecure about her looks and rarely felt comfortable in front of a camera. However, that all changed with the passing of time (and probably a little bit of surgery).</p><p>Nowadays, Nicki Minaj has one of the best bodies in the music industry and she isn’t afraid to flaunt it. The female rapper has appeared scantily clad in dozens of advertisements and music videos and has had little problem with shedding her clothes entirely should the situation call for it. One of Minaj’s most risqué shots came when she posed for Billboard magazine with only her forearms covering her breasts for a topless cover, which seems like an oxymoron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p>Over the last two years or so, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> has stolen <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>’s crown as the most beloved member of the Jenner-Kardashian family. Though she is barely an adult, she has made a name for herself and stolen the spotlight from Kim the same way Kim captured it in the first place: by showing skin.</p><p>Jenner has earned a reputation as something of a fashionista through a series of unique and revealing outfits. She has often appeared on red carpets and at television events looking like she has just come from a day at the beach. The greatest thing about Kylie’s dress sense is that it doesn’t seem forced.</p><p>Too often we see celebrities wearing skimpy outfits for the sake of wearing skimpy outfits, but with Kylie Jenner, it seems perfectly natural. She looks as comfortable in a pair of 6-inch heels and PVC hot pants as most of us do in a pair of sneakers and sweatpants. She frequently strips down to her underwear for photo shoots and shares bikini selfies via her Instagram account on an almost daily basis. And when you consider she has her own swimsuit line, you can imagine the swimsuits aren't going to stop coming anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick><strong>Danica Patrick</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Danica Patrick</a> is one of the finest female stock car drivers in the world today. Defying gender expectations, Patrick has risen through the ranks to become one of the most popular competitors in an industry almost entirely dominated by men.</p><p>While Patrick tends to be fully clothed when she is behind the wheel of a car, her side-career as a model and actress means there is no shortage of images of her in bikinis, underwear, and other revealing outfits. On top of that, Patrick is a fitness enthusiast and regularly shares pictures of herself post-workout, dripping in sweat while clad in Lycra short shorts.</p><p>Patrick’s nakedness is certainly not to benefit herself (though it’s clear she enjoys the feeling of the air against her skin). She is an advocate for women’s rights and often encourages the “normal” women of the world to exceed what is expected of them and to look hot while doing so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keira-knightley><strong>Keira Knightley</strong></h2><p>British actress <a href=#>Keira Knightley</a> is particularly fond of taking her clothes off in front of a camera. She made her first nude film appearance in The Hole when she was just 16 years of age and pretty much just went from there.</p><p>Since the release of The Hole, Keira Knightley has exposed herself in movies such as Silk, The Duchess, The Edge of Love, and, rather ironically, The Jacket. But that doesn’t even cover all of the films in which Knightley has shown skin. She has appeared naked in countless movies over the years, but we simply can’t list them here due to time constraints.</p><p>During a promotional interview for The Edge of Love, Knightley was asked about her much-talked-about nude scene in the film. The actress scoffed and replied by saying “I always bare my breasts, it’s not like it’s only in this film.”</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> made a name for herself in the most old school way possible: making a sex tape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the “leak” of that tape - which was actually orchestrated by Kardashian herself - Kim has made a habit out of appearing naked on camera. The socialite’s nude photographs rarely fail to get people talking, whether they are simply posted to her Instagram account or placed on the cover of a magazine.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous evidence of Kim K’s love of getting naked came when she attempted to “break the internet” by posing for Paper magazine. The now infamous shoot saw Kardashian wearing little more than a pearl necklace, revealing her sizeable and, more likely than not, photoshopped rear end to the world.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></h2><p>It isn’t just women who like to get naked. Some of Hollywood’s greatest male stars have been known to strip down to their birthday suit with some degree of regularity, which we’re sure our female readers will be ecstatic about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Nick Jonas</a> started out as the picture of purity, joining up with his brothers to become one of The Disney Channel’s greatest stars. Like so many Disney celebrities before him, however, Jonas has spent the past couple of years trying to rid himself of the goody-two-shoes image Disney so carefully manufactured for him.</p><p>Jonas has made a habit out of taking his shirt off, revealing a frustratingly chiseled torso beneath. He has appeared topless on magazine covers and on movie posters, not to mention on television shows such as Scream Queens, On Air With Ryan Seacrest, and Running Wild with Bear Grylls.</p><p>The former teen heartthrob has also been known to post topless selfies to Instagram under the guise of providing his followers with an update on his attempts to eat healthy.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>Was there really anybody else who could top this list of celebrities who love to take their clothes off?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like Nick Jonas, who featured a little earlier on this list, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> began her career as a squeaky clean Disney character. After her deal with Disney came to an end, however, Cyrus set about ridding herself of the Hannah Montana character through a series of controversial acts. As well as releasing a series of provocative pop songs and smoking weed on stage, Miley took to appearing nude whenever she had the chance. She exposed herself to the world on red carpets and on live television, not to mention through her various social media accounts.</p><p>While Cyrus’ nudity in the past didn’t really serve any purpose other than to let people know she wasn’t a teenage girl anymore, the singer has managed to turn her love of being naked into a positive in recent years. She now uses her naked selfies to promote body positivity and show her support for the “Free the Nipple” movement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-ferrell><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> likes getting naked just as much as Nick Jonas or Keira Knightley, albeit for very different reasons. Unlike the other celebrities we have covered on this list so far, Will Ferrell doesn’t expose himself because he is proud of his body and wants to flaunt it. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Will Ferrell likes to appear naked in his movies and television roles because he thinks it is absolutely hilarious. And it sort of is.</p><p>It’s pretty difficult to explain what it is that makes us laugh so much, but there's just something about seeing Will Ferrell’s aging body squeezed into a pair of tighty whities that has us rolling on the floor in hysterics. Seeing him stripped down, in turn, strips us down. It removes all the pretentiousness, all of the comic snobbery, and turns us into school kids, giggling at a dirty joke. Even the most ardent foreign film fan would have a hard time not laughing at Ferrell streaking through the streets in 2003’s Old School.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-bieber><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>Not too long ago, it was only 14-year-old-girls who were allowed to be attracted to <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>. Now that the Canadian pop sensation has come of age, however, it is perfectly acceptable for women everywhere to ogle his shirtless body. And boy do they have plenty of opportunities.</p><p>Since reaching maturity, Bieber has made a habit out of strolling around with his shirt off, proudly displaying his toned physique and totally unironic cross tattoo. On certain occasions, he has even been known to remove his trousers and strut around in what is likely one of several thousand pairs of Calvin Kleins in his wardrobe.</p><p>The Biebs loves getting naked so much that he often wears his birthday suit to family gatherings. In fact, in 2013, a video emerged of him serenading his grandmother while completely naked, his privates covered only by the guitar he was badly strumming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> is considered by many to be a fashion icon, while others consider her to be completely insane. Whatever she is, it’s impossible to deny that the woman who once attended the MTV Video Music Awards in a dress composed entirely of steaks has a very interesting dress sense. It is ironic, then, that somebody so well-known for her outrageous outfits, loves to strip down to her bare skin.</p><p>While Gaga has often appeared on stage and at award shows with her body fully covered, she has also been known to turn up wearing close to nothing at all. The Poker Face singer has been seen in the past roaming the streets of New York clad in little more than a bra and mini skirt.</p><p>She has worn similar outfits in the streets of Europe, including an almost see-through bra which she rocked on a night out in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey><strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></h2><p>With roles in such modern classics as The Wolf of Wall Street, Interstellar, and Dallas Buyers Club, <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a> has established himself as one of the finest actors in all of Hollywood. He wasn’t always so revered, however. In the early days of his career, McConaughey was viewed as a bit of a joke by his contemporaries and critics. His tendency to get naked in front of the camera led many to assume he was attempting to mask the fact that he wasn’t all that great of an actor. Of course, we now know that McConaughey knows his way around a script, which means all those times he got naked he did so for the sheer thrill of it.</p><p>In 1999, however, McConaughey took his love of being nude too far when he was arrested for playing bongos without a stitch of clothing on.</p><p>While he was in his own house at the time, he was blaring music at three in the morning and, according to the police report, stomping around the living room while another man looked on and applauded. The Dazed and Confused star was later found to be under the influence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the disturbance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-kidman><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></h2><p>Recently, The Huffington Post ran an article looking at <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>’s new obsession with animal clothing. When we say “animal clothing”, we’re not talking about clothes made out of animals. Not by a long shot. We mean clothes with pictures of animals on them. This is surprising for a number of reasons. For a start, Kidman’s animal dresses don’t look particularly fashionable and would be more at home in a thrift shop than on a red carpet.</p><p>Secondly, Kidman has never really expressed any fondness towards animals in the past. Finally, Nicole Kidman’s love of animal clothing comes as a surprise to us followers of Hollywood because for years the Australian star was reluctant to wear any clothes at all, be they animal themed or otherwise.</p><p>In her younger years, Nicole Kidman made a name for herself by appearing nude in pretty much every movie she scored a role in. It could be argued that during her first few acting gigs, it was Kidman’s body that was giving the performance and not her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-barrymore><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></h2><p>Being part of a famous family can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you rarely have to worry about money and you can score major deals with movie studios and modeling agencies by having your parents make a phone call. On the darker side of things, however, you are plagued by the constant presence of the press and the burden of escaping the shadow of your mother and father. For <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>, the pressures of fame proved to be too much and she turned to alcohol and drugs at an early age.</p><p>At the height of her drug use, Barrymore made a habit of exposing herself in public. She even flashed her breasts to <a href=#>David Letterman</a> while appearing on an episode of The Late Show, much to the delight of the crowd and, probably, Letterman himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barrymore also made many informed, sober decisions to show her body to the world. In 1995, she appeared nude in a January edition of Playboy. While her photos were met with great enthusiasm by the majority of Playboy readers, her godfather, <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>, was not best pleased with the photo shoot and gifted her a blanket along with a note reading “Cover yourself up.”</p><h2 id=bryan-cranston><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong></h2><p>Much like Will Ferrell, <a href=#>Bryan Cranston</a> knows the comedic value of getting naked when you have absolutely no reason to do so. Cranston first began to experiment with the possibilities of a hairy chest and a pair of tighty whities when he was starring as Hal in Malcolm in the Middle.</p><p>On more than one occasion, the patriarch of the Wilkerson clan (yes, they had a surname) was shown wearing nothing but his underwear and a pair of socks as he went about his daily business. In one grotesque yet hilarious scene, Cranston is seen dancing around the bathroom in his briefs, drumming on his belly while his horrified wife looks on from the bathtub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later in his career, Cranston drew on what he learned during the filming of Malcolm in the Middle to add a comedic layer to the character of Walter White, the main character of Breaking Bad. Although White’s tale was a tragic one, Cranston was occasionally able to take the audience away from the main story to give them a few moments of laughter by roaming the house - and sometimes the desert - in nothing but his extremely tight, yet not all that white, underwear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mmpqmpGK4prHPZquhnZmneqS4zq2fnqtdpLtw</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html&title=15%20Celebrities%20Who%20Can%27t%20Keep%20Their%20Clothes%20On" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html&description=15%20Celebrities%20Who%20Can%27t%20Keep%20Their%20Clothes%20On" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html&title=15%20Celebrities%20Who%20Can%27t%20Keep%20Their%20Clothes%20On" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html&title=15%20Celebrities%20Who%20Can%27t%20Keep%20Their%20Clothes%20On" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html&text=15%20Celebrities%20Who%20Can%27t%20Keep%20Their%20Clothes%20On" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f15-celebrities-who-cant-keep-their-clothes-on.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Billy Koelling</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-19</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./9-most-incredibly-luxurious-private-jet-amenities.html><h3>&lt;&lt; 9 Most Incredibly Luxurious Private Jet Amenities</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./once-upon-a-time-cast-10-years-later-where-are-they-now.html><h3>10 Years Later; Where Are They Now? >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
