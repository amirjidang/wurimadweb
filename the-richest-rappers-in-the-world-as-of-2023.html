And the rise of social media has only opened the door for other streams of income to be made, both by contracted and <a href=#>independent artists</a>. And as rappers have a tendency to shamelessly flaunt their assets and possessions, we're well aware of pricey items like <a href=#>Drake's $20 million YOLO estate</a>, Jay-Z's $28 million Rolls Royce Boat Tail convertible he bought together with his wife Beyonce, and Sean "Diddy" Combs fleet of fast cars. Here are 10 of the richest rappers of 2022, ranked.</p><h2 id=kanye-west---6-6-billion>Kanye West - $6.6 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heading off the list is a man who can undoubtedly put his money where his mouth is. <a href=#>Kanye West has been the topic of discussion on a global level</a> for more than a decade now, but in recent months, he has really stolen the spotlight with some of the controversy that he was a part of. First recognized as a producer on the rapper Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, West went on to establish himself as one of the most diverse and unique rap artists in hip hop, selling close to 36 million records over the course of his solo rap career, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Best Selling Albums.</a></p><p>While he still releases music, he is also invested as a fashion designer and had once <a href=#>collaborated with Nike</a>, Gap, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. and also released his Yeezy fashion wear in collaboration with Adidas. Today, his net worth is $6.6 billion.</p><h2 id=jay-z---1-3-billion>Jay-Z - $1.3 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Believe it or not, Jay-Z is known for much more than marrying the Queen of Pop, <a href=#>singer and actress Beyonce Knowles</a>. The Brooklyn, New York rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur has cemented himself as one of the greatest rappers in history. Through the founding of his talent and entertainment agency Roc-Nation, he has brought multiple artists to stardom, such as Savage x Fenty CEO and singer Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion</a>, and rapper Big Sean. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to HypeBeast</a>, much of Jay-Z's wealth comes from his ownership stake in Roc Nation, as well as his champagne company, Armand de Brignac. Since the start of his career to 1996 until present, he has sold over 140 million records worldwide, and holds a net worth of $1.3 billion.</p><h2 id=sean-diddy-combs---900-million>Sean "Diddy" Combs - $900 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another name that has been ringing in hip hop circles for decades on end in Sean "Diddy" Combs, P. Diddy, Diddy Love - whichever one floats your boat. At 53 years old, there doesn't seem to be anything the Harlem, New York native hasn't dabbled his hands in. Known mostly for founding his own record label, Bad Boy, in 1993, a large part of Combs' success and fame can be credited to the <a href=#>Brooklyn rap-extraordinaire, The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, better known as Biggie Smalls. Other talents such as rappers Lil' Kim, Craig Mack, Bow Wow, Machine Gun Kelly, and singer/actress and former wife of the deceased Biggie Smalls, Faith Evans, were also signed to Bad Boy.</p><p>However, Combs' also made a great sum of money from other business investments such as his Ciroc vodka brand, the Sean John clothing line, a huge stake in Revolt TV, and the Aquahydrate beverage company he owns with <a href=#>Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg</a> and businessman Ronald Burkle.</p><h2 id=dr-dre---500-million>Dr. Dre - $500 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leaving the East Coast, we're heading over to the West Coast where we have one of the founding fathers of the west coast style of rap, Dr. Dre. Born Andre Young, he helped pave the way for "gangsta rap" along with <a href=#>rapper/actor Snoop Dogg</a>, Ice-Cube, Ice T, and other members of the N.W.A. rap group such as Eazy-E, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince. Although he has released a few timeless rap songs with rapper such as the late Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, he really shone as a producer.</p><p>In his early days, he produced albums for Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube before founding his own record label, Aftermath Entertainment.
